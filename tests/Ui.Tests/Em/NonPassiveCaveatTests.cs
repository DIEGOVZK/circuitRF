// PCAL2's finding one case further on. A `.sNp` on disk carries no notes, and the run's NOT PASSIVE
// sentence is the last of thirty; on the shipped MMIC spiral the four rows below ~0.8 GHz read
// 110 nH against a real 2.8 nH with sigma_max up to 1.09, and a user opening that file in the Data
// Display six months later sees a smooth, plausible curve with nothing on it to say so.
//
// Gated against `ValidityCaveats` directly rather than through a run: the predicate is the whole of
// the change, and a full-wave sweep that happens to be non-passive costs minutes to reproduce and
// would be gating the sweep rather than the sentence.
