// The Model Composer document, a .cmc (brief-modelcomposer-3 R-mc3-1, R-mc3-2; overview D1, D2, D6, D11).
//
// A .cmc records WHAT DATA a model is built from and UNDER WHAT CONDITIONS. It never holds the data:
// sources are paths relative to the .cmc, and their parsed form lives in <name>.cmc-cache/, which is
// derived and may be deleted (CmcCache). The user's own decisions about the data — which points are
// excluded and why — are document state, because the cache must hold nothing a re-import cannot rebuild.
//
// NUMBERS ARE BASE SI: volts, amps, seconds, ohms, hertz. The one exception is temperature, in °C,
// because that is what a chuck is set to and what the elaborator's `temp` is.
//
// Pads, Network and Steps are carried as JSON and written back exactly, so a document saved by one build loses
// nothing a later one wrote. Pads and Network are read and validated through CmcExtrinsic (MC-4).
